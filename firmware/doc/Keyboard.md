Keyboard.c
=============

It is the original source file from one of the examples in
[LUFA project](http://code.google.com/p/lufa-lib/).
And some usages of functions here would be known as below.
It is my thought, if not correct, please notice me and I
will correct it.

## int main(void)
> Main program entry point. This routine contains the
  overall program flow, including initial setup of all
  components and the main program loop.

## void SetupHardware(void)
> Configures the board hardware and chip peripherals for the
  demo's functionality.
